The absence of digital distractions reduces the disruptive effects of artificial light on your circadian rhythm, helping you ease into a peaceful night's sleep. In this way, reading bridges the gap between the hustle and bustle of the day and the tranquility of the night, ensuring a more restorative and rejuvenating sleep pattern.",
